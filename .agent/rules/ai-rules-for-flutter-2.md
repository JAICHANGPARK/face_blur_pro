# AI rules for Flutter 

## Lint Rules

Include the package in the `analysis_options.yaml` file. Use the following
analysis_options.yaml file as a starting point:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    # Add additional lint rules here:
    # avoid_print: false
    # prefer_single_quotes: true
```
### State Management
* **Built-in Solutions:** Prefer Flutter's built-in state management solutions.
  Do not use a third-party package unless explicitly requested.
* **Streams:** Use `Streams` and `StreamBuilder` for handling a sequence of
  asynchronous events.
* **Futures:** Use `Futures` and `FutureBuilder` for handling a single
  asynchronous operation that will complete in the future.
* **ValueNotifier:** Use `ValueNotifier` with `ValueListenableBuilder` for
  simple, local state that involves a single value.

  ```dart
  // Define a ValueNotifier to hold the state.
  final ValueNotifier<int> _counter = ValueNotifier<int>(0);

  // Use ValueListenableBuilder to listen and rebuild.
  ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
    valueListenable: _counter,
    builder: (context, value, child) {
      return Text('Count: $value');
    },
  );
    ```

* **ChangeNotifier:** For state that is more complex or shared across multiple
  widgets, use `ChangeNotifier`.
* **ListenableBuilder:** Use `ListenableBuilder` to listen to changes from a
  `ChangeNotifier` or other `Listenable`.
* **MVVM:** When a more robust solution is needed, structure the app using the
  Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
* **Dependency Injection:** Use simple manual constructor dependency injection
  to make a class's dependencies explicit in its API, and to manage dependencies
  between different layers of the application.
* **Provider:** If a dependency injection solution beyond manual constructor
  injection is explicitly requested, `provider` can be used to make services,
  repositories, or complex state objects available to the UI layer without tight
  coupling (note: this document generally defaults against third-party packages
  for state management unless explicitly requested).

### Data Flow
* **Data Structures:** Define data structures (classes) to represent the data
  used in the application.
* **Data Abstraction:** Abstract data sources (e.g., API calls, database
  operations) using Repositories/Services to promote testability.

### Routing
* **GoRouter:** Use the `go_router` package for declarative navigation, deep
  linking, and web support.
* **GoRouter Setup:** To use `go_router`, first add it to your `pubspec.yaml`
  using the `pub` tool's `add` command.

  ```dart
  // 1. Add the dependency
  // flutter pub add go_router

  // 2. Configure the router
  final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
    routes: <RouteBase>[
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
        routes: <RouteBase>[
          GoRoute(
            path: 'details/:id', // Route with a path parameter
            builder: (context, state) {
              final String id = state.pathParameters['id']!;
              return DetailScreen(id: id);
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  );

  // 3. Use it in your MaterialApp
  MaterialApp.router(
    routerConfig: _router,
  );
  ```
* **Authentication Redirects:** Configure `go_router`'s `redirect` property to
  handle authentication flows, ensuring users are redirected to the login screen
  when unauthorized, and back to their intended destination after successful
  login.

* **Navigator:** Use the built-in `Navigator` for short-lived screens that do
  not need to be deep-linkable, such as dialogs or temporary views.

  ```dart
  // Push a new screen onto the stack
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const DetailsScreen()),
  );

  // Pop the current screen to go back
  Navigator.pop(context);
  ```

### Data Handling & Serialization
* **JSON Serialization:** Use `json_serial
